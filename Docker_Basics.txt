Docker Basics
==============

By docker it is easier for tester to test software from developer


Container
-----------

    * A way to packacge an apllication  with all necessary  dependecies and configuration
    * It can be easily shared
    * Makes deployment & development efficient


Architecture of Docker
-----------------------

    Hardware -> OS -> Docker Enginer -> Container

    There can multiple docker

    Hardware -> OS -> Docker Enginer -> Container (v1)  version 1 
                                     -> Container (v2)  version 2


Docker Container Vs VMs
-----------------------

    Docker Container -> Low impact on OS, very fast, low disk space usage
    VMs              -> High impact on OS, slower , high disk space usage
    
    Docker Container -> Sharing, rebuilding & distribution is easy 
    VMs              -> Sharing, rebuilding & distribution is challenging
    
    Docker Container -> Encapsulate apps instesad of whole machine  
    VMs              -> Encapsulate whole machine
