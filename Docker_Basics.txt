Docker Basics
==============

By docker it is easier for tester to test software from developer


Container
-----------

    * A way to packacge an apllication  with all necessary  dependecies and configuration
    * It can be easily shared
    * Makes deployment & development efficient


Architecture of Docker
-----------------------

    Hardware -> OS -> Docker Enginer -> Container

    There can multiple docker

    Hardware -> OS -> Docker Enginer -> Container (v1)  version 1 
                                     -> Container (v2)  version 2


Docker Container Vs VMs
-----------------------

    Docker Container -> Low impact on OS, very fast, low disk space usage
    VMs              -> High impact on OS, slower , high disk space usage
    
    Docker Container -> Sharing, rebuilding & distribution is easy 
    VMs              -> Sharing, rebuilding & distribution is challenging
    
    Docker Container -> Encapsulate apps instesad of whole machine  
    VMs              -> Encapsulate whole machine


Main Componnents of Docker
--------------------------

    * Dockery File
    * Dockery Image
    * Dockery Container
    * Dockery Registry 

See Image Docker_Basics.png



Docker Reigister 
---------------- 
    is centeral repository for storing & distributing Docker images



Note ->  A registry is a centralized location that stores and manages container images, whereas a repository is a collection of related container images within a registry. 


Also remember that doker file doesnt have extension it just written DockerFile without extension



use -> FROM ---
    ex -> FROM node
use version number like -> FROM <repository_name>:<n>
    ex -> FROM node:20



*      docker run -p host_port:container_port <image-id>
        p means here continer port publish a container's port to the host

    host_port: The port on the host machine.
    container_port: The port inside the Docker container.

* We can't bind the same host port to multiple Docker containers simultaneously other wise port conflic error will come.

* -d (Detach Mode)
    Purpose: The -d flag is used to run the Docker container in detached mode.
    Behavior: When a container is started in detached mode, it runs in the background, and the command prompt returns immediately.


  -p (Port Mapping)
    Purpose: The -p flag is used to map ports from the host machine to the Docker container.


Doing changes to project (fixing bug, updates):  
    we can just do new tag version 2



Push Image in DockerHub
======================= 
    We can uploda our image in docker hub, other team can download from There

    You can create in   hub.docker.com  and create repository 

    You can push new tag -> docker push <userid>/<repo-name>:tagname 

    You have to login using docker login on terminal -> docker login

    To push with onlin <userid>/<repo-name> you have to first build the image the push possible 
    Just like github you can push in docker -> 
        ex -> docker build -t pranjalkumar09/webapp-demo:01 .

    docker push <userid>/<repo-name> 
        ex-> docker push pranjalkumar09/webapp-demo:01

    When we push different tag/version of image in docker then we might see coming "Layer already exists" coming in terminal this shows how docker smartly link same thing


Docker Pulling
==============
    To pull online docker image in remote system => docker pull <userid>/<repo-name>
                docker pull pranjalkumar09/webapp-demo:02

    Now we can even make conatiner for this 


Docker Volume
